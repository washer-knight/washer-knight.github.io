****How might the two variables of interest be related theoretically?****

-Their relationship is based on the applicant's affordability and income is the key factor of it. 
-The two variables—loan amount and applicant’s income, are positively correlated; which is to say that
as the applicant's income increases, the loan amount received from the banking institution will also increase and vice-versa.
