****Introduction****

 - The two agricultural crops to be discussed in this empirical project are Soybeans and Corn, where the prices of these two goods in relation to each other are analysed using a number of concepts relating to time series analysis. Employing measures, namely cointegration tests and error correction models, while also utilising key components of a time series variable such as unit roots, aided in determining the existence of a causal link between the prices of the two variables.

 - Understanding the nature in which prices of agricultural goods fluctuate and move together, especially in this case, where such trends are found to be cointegrating, is important for supply-demand analysis, as we know from Economic theory that rising prices are a good indicator for increasing levels of consumer demand, and vice-versa. Whatâ€™s more, this drives the choices firms make at a higher level.

 - **Tests and Econometric Models Utilized**

    - Unit Root
    - Cointegration
    - Engle-Granger Test
    - Johansen Test
  
   **Empirical Results**
 - The first tests ran are informal checks for non-stationarity, a time series plot of the logarithm of corn prices and logarithm of soybean prices and a plot of the first differences of the two variables. The variables both appear to be non-stationary as they do not have a constant mean and variance. As can be seen from (figure 1.1) both corn and soybean prices follow a fairly constant upward trend and exhibit the same cyclic pattern, soybeans are the most volatile of the two variables. This leads us to use differencing to remove trends and generate plots of series of first differences. (Figure 1.2) shows that the mean and variance now appear to be constant implying that the variables are now stationary, again soybeans can be seen to be the more volatile of the two variables.
