Over the 2024–2025 academic year, I worked at the University of Strathclyde Students’ Union as a Student Engagement Assistant under the Campaigns department, where I managed a diverse portfolio of strategic initiatives. This involved cross-functional project management, stakeholder coordination, campaign analysis, and the production of digital assets to drive engagement and inform organizational decisions. Here are some of the graphics I developed for the intitiatives I worked on.
